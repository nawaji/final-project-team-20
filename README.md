# TicTacToe

Play Tic-Tac-Toe against a CPU and compete against others for the most wins.

## How to play

Clicking on an open space on the board puts an "X". 

To win, you need to place 3 "X"s in a straight line across the board. 

A CPU will place an "O" every time you place an "X".

## How to install

Download the source code using the "Code" button, with either of the available options for cloning the code.
